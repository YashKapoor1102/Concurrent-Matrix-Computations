Discussion of Test Results

- I tested my program thoroughly with a number of different sets of data values.
  Specifically, I tested many different matrices to ensure my program works properly. 
  Below are two data sets that I tested:


Test Data Set #1 (Mandatory Data Set):

Input: M = 20 20 50
	   10 6  70
 	   40 3  2

Outputs: 

Child Process (P3): working with element 3 of D
Child Process (P2): working with element 2 of D
Child Process (P1): working with element 1 of D


Start Time: 1634690948.944801 sec
End Time: 1634690948.945100 sec

Computational time to perform all the operations: 299 micro sec


The determinant of this matrix is: 41140

The largest value in this matrix is: 70



Test Data Set #2 (Additional Data Set):

Input: M = 5   30  60
	   40  70  90
           25  60  80

Outputs: 

Child Process (P3): working with element 3 of D
Child Process (P2): working with element 2 of D
Child Process (P1): working with element 1 of D


Start Time: 1634698374.507920 sec
End Time: 1634698374.508193 sec

Computational time to perform all the operations: 273 micro sec


The determinant of this matrix is: 11500

The largest value in this matrix is: 90




Conclusion:

- After manually calculating the determinant, I can conclude that my program calculates the  
  determinant of both matrices correctly. Also, it is evident that the largest values
  in the first and second matrices are 70 and 90, respectively. Hence, my program is 
  functioning the way it is supposed to.

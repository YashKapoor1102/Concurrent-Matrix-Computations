					Important Goals of my Design

In this project, I programmed a concurrent program that consists of three processes that compute 
the determinant and find the largest integer of a 3x3 matrix. I will describe the important goals of my 
design using point form:
-	I used a 2D array to store the 3x3 matrix. 
-	I created 3 child processes from a single parent process, so that each individual child process can 
	compute the largest integer in each row and values of array D (D[1], D[2], and D[3]). In this case, 
	the array D helped one of the child processes to calculate the determinant of the matrix. 
-	To store the largest integer in each row and the values of array D, I used Linux shared memory, 
	so I can make one of the child processes calculate the determinant and the largest integer in the 
	whole matrix. 
-	Since the last child process to finish was P1 (I named each process in the DET.c file -> P1, P2, and 
	P3), I made P1 calculate the determinant by adding all the values of array D. Then, I found the 
	largest value in the entire matrix by comparing the maximum value of each row in the matrix.
-	After using one of the child processes (i.e., P1) to calculate the determinant and the largest 
	value in the matrix, I put them (determinant and largest value) in shared memory, so I can use 
	the parent process to print out that information.
-	I made the parent process wait until all the child processes were finished. Then, I made it print 
	out the determinant and the largest value in the matrix to the user. Finally, I exited the program 
	after all processes finished executing successfully.
